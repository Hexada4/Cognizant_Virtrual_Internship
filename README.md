# Cognizant virtual internship program

**Brief description of this program**
<p>During this program, you will get the opportunity to step into the shoes of a Cognizant team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that our Artificial Intelligence team does every day. Youâ€™ll learn how to perform exploratory data analysis, communicate results of a machine learning model, implement algorithm production, and review algorithm performance.
</p>

**The tasks, which I did here**:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: exploring customer data to identify next steps
- Data Modeling: understanding relational data and framing a problem statement
- Model Building and Interpretation: building a predictive model and interpreting the results back to the business
- Machine Learning Production: developing machine learning algorithms for production
- Quality Assurance: evaluating the production machine learning model to ensure quality results
